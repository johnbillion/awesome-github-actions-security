# Contribution guidelines

## Adding to this list

If you wish to add a resource to this list, your pull request is welcome as long as the resource is one that you actually use and recommend. If you have not used the resource yourself, feel free to open an issue to discuss the resource instead of a PR.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Please submit your contribution at the end of the list of the relevant category. If you don't find a section that it belongs in, please make one.
- Please don't use bold or italics unless it's somehow appropriate to the link.
- Make sure the resource is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and you actually use and recommend the resource.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- New headings, categories or improvements to the existing are welcome.
- Please check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the resource.

Thank you for your suggestions!
